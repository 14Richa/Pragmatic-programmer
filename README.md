#### CHAPTER-1
###### Learning is a continuos and ongoing process. 
In the first chapter Andrew Hunt tells us about who is a `Pragmatic Programmer` and how to become one. First chapter contains small interesting life stories which teaches us about a lot of things in general. He tells us about how to take a charge of our own career and don't be afraid to admit errors. He also talk about to be proud of our abilities and to be honest about our shortcomings.  He emphasis on removing `it can't be done` with `what can be done to solve the solution`. Further he talks about `Software Rot` and how it effect the software engineer life. He also writes to not live with broken windows and fix each one as soon as it is discovered. He also shares about how people find it easier to join an ongoing process, and how the atittude of people changes when we show them the glimse of future with help of famou `Stone Soup` story. He emphasis on the importance of quality of code and involvement of users. 
Further he compares the `knowledge portfolio` with `financial portfolio`. And talks about investing regulary in the knowledge portfolio. He also pens down the importance of setting goals for eg: to learn one language every year, reading a technical book, reading a non-technical book (don't forget the human side as computers are used by people), to stay updated and so on. At the end of the first chapter he talks about the importance of communication and to be a good listener. 
And ends with the famous quote : "It's both what you say and the way you say it". 

#### CHAPTER-2
###### Approach to become a Pragmatic Programmer.
In chapter two Andrew Hunt pens down few points for a pragmatic approach. He talks about duplication of a code and how it plays like an evil in software engineer life. He writes down few reasons by which duplication arises (imposed duplication, inadvertent duplication, impatient duplication and interdeveloper duplication). 
Further in the chapter Mr. Andrew tells us about the benefit of `orthogonality` (if changes in one do not affect any other thing)in the software world.He further adds about `reversibility`.
